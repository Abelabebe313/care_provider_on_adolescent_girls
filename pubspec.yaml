  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins-SemiBold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf

    - family: Urbanist-Italic
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Italic.ttf

    - family: Urbanist-Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Bold.ttf

    - family: Urbanist-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Regular.ttf

    - family: Urbanist-Light
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Light.ttf
