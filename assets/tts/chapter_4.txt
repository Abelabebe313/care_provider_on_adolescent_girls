Sexually-Transmitted Infections. 
Preventions, Control and Treatment.
Many STIs can occur, without noticeable symptoms (WHO 2018d: 329). The most effective combination preventions for sexually transmitted infections are behavioural, biomedical and structural approaches.
Sexually transmitted infections can be controlled through providing information and services such as individual counselling and the required treatment, improving health care-seeking behaviour, early identification and treatment, and appropriate case management (FMoH 2017a:26). One of the primary responsibilities of midwives is to provide sexually transmitted infections prevention, counselling and treatment (ICM 2019:13). Competent health care providers, on the other hand, diagnosed and treated sexually transmitted infections in adolescent girls in 36.4 % of cases, with 12.4% providing this service on weekends and at night.
