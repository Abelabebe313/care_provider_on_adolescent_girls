GENDERâ€“BASED VIOLENCE SERVICES.
Gender-based violence (GBV), is defined as, violence involving men and women in whom the woman is typically the victim (Bott, Sarah, et al., 2004). Sexual violence includes rape, sexual slavery and/or trafficking, forced pregnancy, sexual harassment, sexual exploitation and abuse, and forced abortion. Violence against women is global, systemic, and rooted in power imbalances and structural inequality (WHO, 2018a: 360). Gender-based violence is a problem that must be addressed. Many women and girls are victims of violence. Midwives and other service providers should identify and assist GBV-affected women and girls (WHO 2018a: 360).
