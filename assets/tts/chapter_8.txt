ADOLESCENT NUTRITION SERVICES.
To promote optimal feeding and care practices, the MoH established the National Nutrition Programme II (NNP II) (CSA & ICF 2016:190).
The MoH established the National Guideline on Adolescent, Maternal, Infant, and Young Child Nutrition (AMIYCN) in 2016 (CSA & ICF 2016:190). Adolescence, like the first thousand days, provides a second window of opportunity for growth and prevention of intergenerational malnutrition. Protein, iron, and other micronutrients are required to support adolescent growth and meet the body's increased demand for iron during menstruation. The most common form of
malnutrition among Ethiopian adolescent girls, (30%) had iron deficiency anemia  (FMoH 2017b: 9).
