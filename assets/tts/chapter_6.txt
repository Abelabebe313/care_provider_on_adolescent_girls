Antenatal, Intrapartum and Postnatal Care Services.
Pregnancy, childbirth, and the first six weeks after childbirth are critical times for maternal and newborn survival. Antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care services serve as a foundation for other critical health care functions (WHO 2018a: 345). One of the primary responsibilities of Competent health care providers is to provide intrapartum care (ICM 2019:17). Almost all midwives in Ethiopia provided antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care for adolescent girls and women in need.
